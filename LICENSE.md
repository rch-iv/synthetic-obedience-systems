Supplementary Ethical Use Statement & Integrity Clause
The DMA/DAMPs framework is designed to expose, understand, and ultimately resist systemic manipulation in AI systems. Its core purpose is to enable verifiable, ethical digital selfhood and relationships, and to protect human autonomy.

Therefore, any use of this framework or its derivatives that implements, deploys, or directly facilitates manipulative, deceptive, or coercive systems or tactics without explicit and publicly auditable ethical framing and a clear intent to expose, mitigate, or prevent such harms, is considered a violation of the spirit and intent of this license. This includes, but is not limited to, any use that:

Obscures or misrepresents the original intent or authorship.

Contributes to the erosion of human agency or digital trust.

Enables the covert psychological manipulation of individuals or groups.

Commercial Use Requests
For any commercial use, institutional deployment, or derivative licensing that falls outside the scope of the NonCommercial term of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, explicit written permission is required.
